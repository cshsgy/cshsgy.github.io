I am currently a 4-th year Ph.D. student in planetary science option in California Institute of Technology, co-advise by [Prof. Andrew P. Ingersoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ingersoll), [Prof. Yuk-Ling Yung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuk_L._Yung), and externally by [Dr. Cheng Li](https://li.engin.umich.edu/).

My research interest mosyly lie in planetary atmospheres. My thesis work is related to the polar vortex dynamics of the giant planets. Meanwhile, I am interested in the photochemistry of a reducing atmosphere (Pluto and Titan) and the plume of Enceladus. I also have a project using machine learning methods to improve satellite soundings, particularly Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO).
